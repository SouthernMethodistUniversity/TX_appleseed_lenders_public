# TX_appleseed_lenders_public
The public facing methodology for Texas Appleseed Payday Lenders project with Professor Spector.

## Project Overview
For the first STARs project focus, we zoomed into focusing on predatory payday lenders in Dallas. Using the licensee dataset, we were able to take these lenders and plot them on a map in relation to the evictions. We were able to plot these as stars on the maps that we generated. Additionally, we used the eviction dataset to plot the locations of all the evictions, which are depicted by dots on the graphs. One thing that we wanted to investigate with the payday lenders was the idea of a walking distance buffer around the lenders. We wanted to do this to show what eviction cases would potentially be able to walk to a payday lender, meaning it is extremely accessible to them. We defined the buffer to be 1500 meters or just under 1 mile. From this buffer map, we were able to not only see what eviction cases fall within walking distance of the lenders, but also the lenders that are in extremely close proximity with others. On the graph below, the purple dots represent the location of individual evictions, the blue stars represent the payday lenders, and the red represents the 1 mile buffer.
